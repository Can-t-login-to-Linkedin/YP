And I regret to use it as such, and I am scared to do so. But I also know that fear is temporary, and regret is forever.Today was the longest and the hardest day in my life. And it will be the longest night. Today in the small city in Ukraine not far from the Russian border, a kindergarten was shelled with uragan (hurricane) weapon. 3 people died, and 8 injured (including one dead kid and one kid fighting for his life in the hospital now). These kids were not in the kindergarten, but they searched for a shelter that was located there and could not manage to hide in time.In one of universities, students and lectors are hiding in shelters on campus, because the territory around the university is heavily shelled with missiles. Streets of my beloved, ancient, beautiful Kyiv are empty. Now, when I write these words, the air Defence alarm is on and people are hiding in bomb-shelters. There are long lines of men, who tried to receive any weapon and be able to help the army and defend the city by themselves. Because the occupation force is overwhelming and army is not enough.I mentioned only these three cases, not because there is nothing else happening today in Ukraine. A lot of people lost their homes and lives today. But this kindergarten was shelled in my hometown Okhtyrka, while my parents were hiding in the basement trying to survive. Okhtyrka is an excellent representation of a \u201cRussian-speaking community in the Eastern Ukraine\u201d, and we never ever experienced any kind of genocide. It is just insane to hear that.This university is my Alma-mater, where I did my masters degree, and I personally know those lectors who are writing from the bomb shelter. And this is my dearest friend, who took a weapon today to protect Kyiv. He is a professor with PhD, and works in international trade relations. And he has never held a weapon in his hands. But today, he is a soldier. Those, who know me, will understand that this is not the fake news. I will ask only for one thing.Kyiv is just 2 hours by plane from Germany. The crimes which happened today in Ukraine are war crimes beyond any \u201cred lines\u201d. Nothing else can be crossed. There is no way back and nothing that can stop him now. There are no such things as country borders or civilians anymore, neither such concept as international law.These few days will be crucial. Please stand with Ukrainians on your streets. Please stand for Ukraine. They deserve it. These people are so brave and amazing, and their courage is what holds the madness and war out of Europe.

With K3s and K8s APIs, Light Edge PC-sized devices can be easily orchestrated, making AKS EE a perfect solution for a ubiquitous orchestration plane.As someone who was part of the private preview of Azure IoT Edge in 2014, I can attest it was excellent at its time and that a lot has changed in the past decade. Today AKS EE is fit for the next decade. If you're using Azure IoT Edge, now is the time to switch to AKS EE.

I'm just not sure how many people will want to run Kubernetes on top of a Linux VM on top of Windows IoT (especially on smaller edge devices in a control cabinet). My feeling is that many that have reached this level of maturity will want to run Kubernetes just on Linux (with running on something like VMWare optionally). I really hope this will be supported as well in the near future.","162":"\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043a \u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043b

how to handle the situation:Stay calm and professional: It can be difficult, but try to remain calm and professional even if the customer is being aggressive. Getting upset or angry will not help the situation.Set boundaries: It is important to establish boundaries and let the customer know what is and is not acceptable behavior.Listen: Allow the customer to fully express their concerns and frustrations. Show that you are listening by using active listening techniques such as nodding, making eye contact, and repeating back what the customer is saying.Empathize: Try to understand the customer's perspective and show that you are empathetic to their situation.Offer a solution: Once you have fully listened to the customer's concerns, try to offer a solution or suggest a course of action.Document the conversation: It is important to document the conversation for your records and to have a record of the steps taken to resolve the issue.Escalate if necessary: If the situation becomes too difficult to handle, it may be necessary to escalate the issue to a manager or supervisor.Remember, the goal is to resolve the issue to the customer's satisfaction while also maintaining your own professionalism and the integrity of the project.","164":"Massoud Rajavi: Greetings to the people and youth who passed away in Karaj and Tehran 6 hours ago Masoud Rajavi Masoud Rajavi: Greetings to the people and young people who died in Karaj and Tehran Karstan, you did something this morning This is the lesson of our explanation since 1958 against Khomeini and Khamenei Lovers of freedom must revolt Break chains and prisons please share\u0645\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f \u0631\u062c\u0648\u06cc: \u062f\u0631\u0648\u062f \u0628\u0631 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0645 \u0648 \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0632 \u062c\u0627\u0646 \u06af\u0630\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u06a9\u0631\u062c \u0648 \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06f6 \u0633\u0627\u0639\u062a \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0645\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f \u0631\u062c\u0648\u06cc\u0645\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f \u0631\u062c\u0648\u06cc:\u062f\u0631\u0648\u062f \u0628\u0631 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0645 \u0648 \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0632 \u062c\u0627\u0646 \u06af\u0630\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u06a9\u0631\u062c \u0648 \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0645\u062f\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0645\u0631\u0648\u0632 \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u06cc\u062f \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0633 \u062a\u0628\u06cc\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0632 \u0633\u0627\u0644\u06f5\u06f8\u00a0\u0631\u0648 \u062f\u0631 \u0631\u0648\u06cc \u062e\u0645\u06cc\u0646\u06cc \u0648 \u062e\u0627\u0645\u0646\u0647\u200c\u0627\u06cc \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0634\u06cc\u0641\u062a\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u0634\u0648\u0631\u0634 \u0648 \u0637\u063a\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0646\u0646\u062f\u0632\u0646\u062c\u06cc\u0631 \u0648 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0634\u06a9\u0646\u0646\u062f\u0644\u0637\u0641\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0634\u062a\u0631\u0627\u06a9 \u0628\u06af\u0630\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062f:","165":"When out-of-box software falls short, a customized solution may be just what your business needs.

He told me the best time to find a job when you're NOT looking for a job for 3 reasons:- You can be as picky as you want without the pressure of NEEDING to find a job- You continue to train your interviewing skills - Most importantly, you validate you are being paid & treated fairlyIn the past 2 years, I've interviewed with over 20 opportunities I saw potential career paths in including Spotify, DoorDash & Facebook - not because I was desperate to leave.But to make sure Google valued me more than everyone else.#JustJerry #Wonsulting","209":"Very exciting that Virgin Galactic has revealed its initial vehicle design for high speed travel: http:\/\/ow.ly\/dOVJ50AP7Fp","210":"Why did Acumatica put the selling and implementing of our cloud ERP software into the hands of Certified Value Added Resellers?

Maxim is more than just a talented developer with over 11 years of experience. He's the hidden core of our organisation, overseeing our entire infrastructure and managing our technological needs with an entrepreneurial spirit that binds our team together. His thirst for knowledge is unquenchable. When he has some free time, he is either learning about new technologies or learning a new language. Maxim can adapt to his surroundings no matter what. His social skills also make him an excellent companion, whereas it doesn't \u00a0matter who he's meeting with or what the topic of conversation is. He appears to be defying the stereotypical developer persona, but funny enough, he prefers to work in darkened environments... So there must still be a stereotypical developer lurking behind the outgoing persona that he is. We're proud to have Maxim as part of our leadership team. He's a true natural and one-of-a-kind.Happy birthday Maxim! \ud83c\udf89 #teams #introduction #persona","229":"Wrote my first program in Rust lang.

Many of them draw an excellent high-level picture and break down what resilience is into smaller buckets. But I've not seen many that explained the things you go through exactly each time you hit the wall. At the same time, I've noticed that on the path of empowering resilience, many of my peers \u2014 including myself \u2014 almost always went through one crucial step, yet barely talked about and brought up to the public or themselves. And recognizing this step could help you bounce back faster whenever you fall.I'm talking about desperation. Let me explain.Let's say you want to get a promotion. You tried asking for a raise directly, are doing extra hours and taking extra responsibilities, and are always there for your peers. But the raise does not happen. And at some point, the perfectly normal questions arise: \"What is going on?\"So, you can treat it differently.You can deny: \"That's alright. I'm right. Let's double down on efforts.\"\u00a0You can devalue: \"Well, this doesn't matter much. Let's focus on my hobby instead.\"\u00a0You can cope any other way.OrYou can face it: \"Oh, this is really happening. Something is wrong, or I am doing something wrong.\"This moment is magical because you will most likely feel desperation. This desperation comes from the realization that you thought something was true, but it was wrong. Could you give yourself time to sit tight with this feeling? Something significant will happen afterward.The feeling eventually will dissolve. And once it's out, you can embrace the recently unknown reality. By being out of those heavy feelings, you also would be able to be calm and to think clearly.This is precisely what we need.No need to mention how powerful this skill is when learning stacks.Let's say you pitch your idea 30 times a week and fail 29 of them. If you'd go through those stages 29 times and feel desperation 29 times, you can adjust your speech 29 times based on feedback and get closer to your goal.But the most beautiful thing happens the last.Once you genuinely integrate that mindset, eventually...You start enjoying your desperation.Because once you feel desperate, you know: \"That means I just learned something new, and my next step will be better, and eventually, I will win.\"Curious to see what your resilience insights are and how this one resonates with you.#mindset\u00a0#growth\u00a0#resilience\u00a0#emotionalintelligence","248":"\u0421\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043a\u0443 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u044b \u0432 \u0421\u0428\u0410 \u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435, \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0447\u0442\u0430\u043b \u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0435 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044b, \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0443\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0438 \u0438 \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432\u0438\u0437!\u0410 \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0443\u044e \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0443 \u0432\u044b \u043c\u0435\u0447\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0445\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043c\u0436?)\u2714 \u0421\u0430\u0439\u0442\u044b \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u044b \u0432 \u0421\u0428\u0410 \u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435 \u2714Dice -

Just yesterday, Russians launched ballistic missiles against the city of Dnipro, killing over 20 people. Only two days ago, Russia launched more than 100 missiles, further devastating Ukraine's critical civilian\u00a0infrastructure and leaving millions without electricity, warmth, or water. Two people were killed in Poland as a consequence of the attack. Meanwhile, Immigram, a software-enabled agency with a 100% Russian team, some\u00a0of whom still live in Russia, actively assists Russians in navigating complex immigration procedures and managing the migration process to maximize the chances of Russians emigrating to the UK and thus escaping the consequences of economic strain imposed on Russia by international sanctions and business leaving country. Allow that to sink in: while some startup founders fight and die on the frontlines for the lives of their families and loved ones and their country's freedom, others seek to assist Russians to escape the repercussions of their acts and inactions\u2026#slush2022 #startup ","251":"\u0430 \u0432\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443-\u0442\u043e \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e!","252":"I\u2019m back at my job search in London. Ta-da)After I finished my work at Action for the first time in my life I decided to give myself a break. I mean, I was tired from work, tired from big uncertainty in my family's life, tired of the stress of moving cats from Thailand to the UK and finding an apartment here in an extremely short time. I needed a little 'sabbatical', time to just settle in, reboot, and eliminate what I think was an early stage of an emotional burndown.I\u2019m not sure that I've completed that 'job' 100%, but at the end of the day I understood that I miss being around people. Working and being a part of the community motivates me, drives me to conquer new challenges and grow. So I want back from my 'sabbatical'.If anyone is looking for a swiss army knife professional to grow their business and products - let me know. ;)Primarily I am looking for Product Manager roles, but would be happy to discuss Program Management roles as well. I have a right to work in the UK but ready for remote opportunities.I appreciate any sharing and likes.

They are also using drones(UVAs).Azerbaijan, taking advantage of the tense international situation, is trying to encroach on the sovereign territory of Armenia with the use of force. The events that are taking place reveal the true face of the so-called era of peace.This is so obvious!The world needs to open its eyes.UNDP United Nations NATO","272":"It\u2019s impossible to bear such news without tears. This is the 21 century, and yet we\u2019re not far from ancient times only because we are geographically close to the modern barbarians\u2026 For those who don\u2019t know. Yesterday russians released a video of Ukrainian soldier being tortured by russian terrorist, and today russians shelled with artillery a place were Ukrainian soldiers were kept as a prisoners of war - according to the news at least 40 people are dead\u2026 It is a complete disregard to Geneva convention and principles of treatment of the prisoners of war. And on top of inhumanity is that russian media and Telegram communities are making fun of it.

I just wish you could hear me and my pain about what is happening today. In 2020, there were mass protests against Lukashenko in Belarus; it was the biggest and longest protest the Belarusian people had seen. We suffered for our political activism. We were beaten to death by the police, our property was taken from us by the government, we were fired from our jobs, we were expelled from universities, we were given fines of sums that were impossible to pay. We waited for support from other countries, we waited for sanctions from the European Union, from the United States. However, no one paid any attention to us. I do not want to blame other countries, they helped to spread the problem of the Belarusians, they helped us with support, I really appreciate it! But what do we see now? Hundreds of people accuse me of being Belarusian, hundreds of people react aggressively to the fact that I speak Russian. I can't work in international business, I can't easily find new contacts and make friends with people from Europe or America. More than 250 thousand people left Belarus in 2020 for political reasons. In percentage terms, that's the same as if 8.5 million people left the United States. People keep leaving because they don't agree with the government because the government of Belarus destroys our lives. I am Belarusian, right now I live in the Czech Republic and I support Ukraine, and every day I fall asleep with fear in my heart.We hate our government and we showed it in 2020. None of the Belarusians want to fight and participate in the war, people are leaving the country en masse because Lukashenko and the government leave us no choice, but now we are not loved anywhere.","301":"TeamworkPlease follow my profile for more videos and news.","302":"\u0420\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0448\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u043e\u0442 \u0421\u0430\u0440\u044b \u041a\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440 - \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440\u043f\u043e\u043f\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0430 TheCooperReview.com \u043e \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0435 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0439! https:\/\/lnkd.in\/dh9GZxB","303":"## NEW ROLE ##Full Stack JavaScript Developer (React\/Node) - 6 month contract - London - \u00a3450-\u00a3500p\/d.

I decided to go into the tech industry. I began to study the topic, ask people, and immediately grabbed a healthy portion of negativity:- Number 1. You're too old- Number 2. You have the wrong race- Number 3. It's too hard, you have to learn a lotIn 2021, I graduated from a coding bootcamp, launched my web development courses, and invested in an IT startup. But it seemed to me that this was not enough. To get into IT for real, you need to be a part of interesting projects.I started applying for developer vacancies.And here's the result - at 51, I got my first offer for the role of a software developer. It is not a fact that I will accept it, but the fact remains that I am in business.This journey took 12 months. It was not easy and there is indeed some truth in the negative.I want to appeal to the \"youth\" 40+, never give up. If I did it when I was 50+, then you can.For my part, I made a decision - from 2022 I will only accept 40+ for my courses.I have nothing against young people, but I want to support those who are being infringed upon.Those who want to study coding can apply in the form in the comments.Happy New Year and good luck in 2022 !!!!#newyear2022 #softwaredeveloper#motivation#recruitment","441":"\u0412\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442!\u041d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0443\u0441\u044c \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0446\u0438\u044e Junior QA. \u0411\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0443\u044e \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043c. \u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e! #qa #cv #worksearching","442":"I\u2019m wishing a Happy New Year to all #espressifers Espressif Systems colleagues all over the world!

Could you get them my contacts? I am a Middle Python + GIS programmer from Moscow, Russia. I started to learn Python 7 years ago, and now I have a lot of local and job projects.

It program calls 'Speaking mouse 5.0'. When I was young, she started to teach me HTML and CSS technology. I think you understand that now that knowledge is very outdated.But I love programming. It looks as you create a book or a painting. For me, it was like art. After HTML and CSS I stopped working with programming, but when I was 13, I wanted to create a mod on the GTA SAMP game. It is a mod for multiplayer gaming where people tried to play roles. And I started to try to create that mod. I spent near 2 years, wrote 10000+ lines of code on PAWN language (simplified C#), but it was great time. I think, my way started there when I wrote my first big code with functions, logic, and...

suggest you to conact Alexander Nikishin. I worked with him for several years and hoped to continue more but due to geopolitical issues and inability to relocate to another country we cannot to do that. So if you are ok to work with person located in Russia you will not regret it. I am pretty sure Sergey Khutoryanskiy can provide his recomendations about Alexander Nikishin as well so feel free to contact me or Sergey Khutoryanskiy if you need to collect feedback.ThanksP.S.

To stop this, we need to go circular. Minimise waste, limit consumption & close the loop.

In this edition, you\u2019ll get a deep walkthrough of JavaScript design patterns interpreted using modern JavaScript language primitives (modules, async\/await, classes, WeakMap etc) and a look into React design and rendering patterns.

For folks who were fans of our work on patterns.dev, this book covers content that\u2019s even more broadly applicable using vanilla JavaScript but also offers extended perspectives on how to think about design patterns, rendering, namespacing, file structure and more topics. Publishing the book is just the start and we\u2019re aiming to share even more guidance (~a supplemental book) and interactive resources soon. It takes a village to ship a project like this. I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to Leena Sohoni, Michele Cronin, Clare Laylock, Amanda Quinn, Kristen Brown, Stoyan Stefanov, Sarah Drasner, Lydia Hallie, O'Reilly and countless others that contributed to the effort.We hope you and your teams find the book helpful.#javascript #webdevelopment #programming #books ","591":"Win more business by doing less....

The challenge was to implement the following functionality: - See all countries from the API on the homepage- Search for a country using an input field- Filter countries by region- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page- Click through to the border countries on the detail page- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark modeI went even further and added authentication, ability to bookmark countries that user have visited, account page to see all the bookmarked countries and ability generate tweet based on that data. There are a few things I still want to improve and work on, but will do that later.

Does it sound fair? For me absolutely not. Scholarships that eliminate Russian citizens from participation do not only discriminate people based on their nationality but also contribute to the Russian government\u00a0\u00a0propaganda. In this particular case, I\u2019m speaking about Mastermind scholarship in Belgium, SISGP in Sweden and Chevening in the UK that are closed for applications for Russian citizens as a method of punishment. 1. That is SO unfair toward those who do not support the Russian regime and do not want to receive the pro-government education. You know who is rich enough in Russia to pay 10 000\u20ac per year for masters degree in Europe? Those who are in power now. Their children have money and possibilities. They don\u2019t need scholarships. Ordinary people from middle class families are not able to pay this amount of money for their education. Scholarships are the only way for them to get a quality education abroad. And yeah, they need it, because the education abroad broadens your horizons, it makes you open-minded because you meet people from other cultures, you see that democracy is not a myth and it is possible to SPEAK UP and NOT get in jail for that. Education changes you in a good way, and it is exactly what we can call a soft power.  2. The more Europe is closed for Russians, the more they believe in \u201cthe whole world hates us\u201d propaganda. When you cut the opportunity to participate in application process, you prove that no one wants Russians, that Europeans hate us (what is, according to my personal experience, is not true at all). This gives the pro-government Russian mass media the material to show that our president is right and \u201cThe Collective West\u201d is against us. As a consequence, people start believing it and they support the regime more. Do you think it will resolve the conflict in a long term? I do not think so. The whole thing that is happening to all Russian students, who do not support the war, makes me angry and sad at the same time. I\u2019ve been there, I know how it feels when the only chance to see the different point of view is education abroad. And you would never be able to afford it while living in Russia. I\u2019m very thankful to my Master Mitra (Transnational Migrations) program for everything it gives us, I\u2019m living my BEST experience in my life, and I see how it makes me more empowered. Education is a soft power and it makes us united. It makes as humans. Do not take a chance from Russian students to become more empowered and change the political situation.P.S. And yes, I\u2019m totally for giving Ukrainians more funding and helping them out, I know it is much more difficult for them now and I do my best to help.","687":"\u0427\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c!\u041b\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u041a\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e - \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u21161 \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0439\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439!","688":"We are always happy to celebrate birthdays at CyberHULL!\u2800Happy Birthday, Hovhannes!\u2800#cyberhull #cyberhullteam #cyberhullarmenia #jobinarmenia","689":"\u0421 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0430\u044e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044f \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\u044e \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0443 \u0432 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u00a0\u2013 Recruitment Specialist \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 Kaspersky!","690":"Welcome to the Wrap-Up \u2013 your summary of the day's top news and talking points, curated by LinkedIn News Europe.

","694":"Is now the time to find a job that pays more?\u00a0Eurozone inflation is soaring \u2014 hitting 9.1% last month \u2014 and for most workers, pay is not keeping up. According to the World Economic Forum, wages have been in the doldrums ever since the global financial crisis of 2007-08. Although they have increased on the back of low inflation since 2012, real wages have only returned to 2008 levels very recently.\u00a0Now, the cost of living crisis triggered by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine is having a huge impact on households, with many workers likely wondering what they can do to make themselves feel more financially secure.\u00a0Finding a new job is often seen as the quickest route to better pay and since the post-pandemic recovery began in 2021 millions of American workers have quit their jobs in the Great Resignation, something that was mirrored on a smaller scale across Europe.\u00a0Economic activity has rebounded this year and low unemployment numbers across Europe point to a strong jobs market, despite inflationary pressure.\u00a0But what impact might the continuing war in Ukraine, a looming winter energy crisis and warnings of an imminent global recession have on the labour market in the coming months?

Choose a good boss- The size of the company you work for doesn\u2019t really matter. Who you work with matter the most. Choose a good boss who will help you unleash your potential. 2. You are worthy If you ever make redundant in a job, don\u2019t ever think you are redundant. Its an awful experience (I tried it), but It\u2019s really not about you. Move on. 3. Build your network online and offline- Your next employer can be someone you met at a random networking event a few years ago. 4. Join a Toastmasters (public speaking) club as early as possible- It\u2019s the best way to build your confidence. 5. Do everything- however how trivial it might seem to be - e.g. making a cup of tea for your client or colleague - it is an art! All experiences teach you something. 6. Be a nice person- Don\u2019t gossip. Help your colleagues. 7. You don\u2019t need a 10-year career plan- You just need to know what you are truly passionate about and go for it. 8. Take holidays regularly- Slow down to go fast. Rest is a necessity. 9. Ask for a mentor in your job- Even an unofficial one. You can get to your next level faster. 10. Keep upgrading your skills- Even for the same job, the skills required may change in 3 years, as the world keeps evolving. Which piece of advice resonates with you? What would you add to the list?

So, frequently I'm thinking about how to make production of oil and gas more clear and environmentally friendly. I've just find an excellent article that surprised me a lot.That was about Integrating Renewable Energy Technologies in Oil and Gas Operations. I would like to share some main points from it just to be clear what does integrating means.1. Upstream: Renewable Integration in Oil and Gas ProductionHere, I can underline 3 ways: - electrification of drilling and recovery means that electric generations can be implemented instead of natural gas ones- offshore wind power can be used to power water injection pumps- solar thermal EOR substitutes natural gas with concentrated solar power (CSP) as the energy source for producing steam.2. Midstream: Renewable Integration in Oil and Gas Transportation- replace gas engines in compressors with electric motors that could increase renewable integration and reduce noise, fuel use, and emissions- start using turboexpanders. The potential energy created from raising pipeline pressure is lost when the pressure is stepped down at distribution hubs. A turboexpander can capture this potential energy to generate electricity3. Downstream:Renewable Integration in Oil Refining- concentrated solar energy can complement or replace conventional fuel as the heating source in several production processes at the refinery.- renewable energy such as solar or can be used to run machinery, such as compressors, pumps, circulators, and controllers, and also can reduce operation costs and carbon emissions.In conclusion, in the nearest future people should be attantive in the issue of the climate change and environment. #oilandgas #drilling #refinery #naturalgas #future","704":"I\u2019m happy to share that I\u2019m starting a new position as Senior Software Developer!","705":"\u041d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0447\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044f. \u0418 \u0432 \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430\u043c \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 :) \u0423\u0447\u0438\u043c\u0441\u044f, \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0434\u0430\u0435\u043c\u0441\u044f, \u0440\u0435\u0431\u044f\u0442\u0430)","706":"As a practice, started doing Personal Kanban and found this nice online kanban board -\u00a0kanbantool.com Worth giving it a try if you need a solution to organise your daily chores.","707":"Hello, I am looking for a new career opportunity and would appreciate your support.

It may not sound exciting, but its power and flexibility make it an indispensable tool for anyone working with data.\u26a1 Whether you're a business owner trying to make sense of your sales data, a researcher analyzing large datasets, or a software developer building applications that rely on databases, SQL is the way to go.With SQL, you can easily perform complex queries, filter and sort data, and aggregate information to gain insights that would be impossible to obtain manually. And because SQL is a standardized language, you can use it with virtually any database system, from MySQL and PostgreSQL to Oracle and SQL Server.But don't just take my word for it. Consider the following examples:\ud83c\udf87 A small business owner uses SQL to analyze customer data and identify trends that help them make informed decisions about marketing and product development.\ud83c\udf87 A researcher uses SQL to join and analyze multiple datasets, uncovering insights that lead to new discoveries and innovations.\ud83c\udf87 A software developer uses SQL to build a web application that requires real-time access to a large database, ensuring that users receive accurate and up-to-date information.As you can see, SQL is a versatile and powerful tool that can help you achieve your goals, no matter what they may be. So why not give it a try and see what insights you can uncover? With SQL, the possibilities are endless!\u2728 Follow Aditi Takale for more!ps: credits to the respective owner(s). #sql\u00a0#commands\u00a0#database\u00a0#sqldeveloper\u00a0#sqlqueries\u00a0#databasequeries\u00a0#sqlprogramming\u00a0#developer\u00a0#programmer\u00a0#functions\u00a0#dataanalytics\u00a0#dataanalyst\u00a0#dataanalysis\u00a0#data #programming #language #softwaredeveloper #development #mysql #oracle #business #artificialintelligence\u00a0#machinelearning\u00a0#technology #ai #ml #datascience","793":"Rest API and HTTP notes.A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) for a LinkedIn post is a web service that allows developers to interact with LinkedIn's platform to retrieve, create, update, or delete posts on behalf of a user or a company.\ud83d\udc65\ud83d\udcdd\ud83d\udd17\ud83d\udcbbThe API enables developers to access various functionalities related to LinkedIn posts, including posting text, images, videos, and links; retrieving post metadata; analyzing engagement metrics; and managing comments and reactions.

The profiles of number of candidates were brought to my attention and then the most promising ones were invited to an in-person interview.I was looking for someone who was an independent contributor and could take initiative to resolve problems and work collaboratively with other team members.In one particular interview I held, the candidate sat in front of me across the meeting table, opened his laptop at the start, without mentioning to me what he was intending to do with the laptop.At one point, after I posed a role related question, the candidate tapped away at his laptop to get some information.I recall that I was not particularly impressed. I had not seen someone respond to interview questions using a computer in person in the moment! I waited with patience for a little time as the response was promised.This occurred more than once during the interview.The interview proceeded to the skills I was looking for and to see if the candidate was a good fit within the team. All I recall was how the processes at the company he worked at were vastly superior to the ones we had in place at that point in time. Very little was said about what the candidate could propose as solutions as a way forward.I had been patient and had given the candidate the chance to show something that first impressions did not.I had made up my mind that the candidate was unsuitable for my team.My observation of the candidate in that interview relates more to their self awareness.\u00a0These are three questions for consideration:\ud83d\udc49How self aware were they of their situation?\ud83d\udc49How self aware were they in the way they presenting themselves?\ud83d\udc49How could this person improve their self awareness?\ud83e\udd14What do you think of this scenario?\ud83e\udd14When have you become aware of self awareness in others?\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\ud83d\udca1 I am Jung, I coach ambitious individuals and purpose-driven businesses to tackle their key challenges, regain control and find purpose (through my personal mastery methodology). \ud83e\udd14\u00a0If you'd like to know more or explore how I could support you, please reach out to me for a strategy call where we can look at what is missing for you in order to achieve what you want and find meaning in what you do.

And it seemed to me that my story was fairly standard as far as my progress turned out to be quite logical and systematic. Just think about it.\ud83d\udccc Comfort environmentEveryone in my family was an engineer. This fact has determined my further way in many respects. First, a computer is a must in the engineering family. Secondly, my father was okay with my interest in video games and even supported it. He installed games and programs, let me play, and waited for my hobby to grow into something bigger. Dad was right.At the age of six, I was pretty sure about creating my own game. I even made my first design document, where I wrote lore, made sketches of characters, weapons and so on. In my mind it looked like a massive RPG, much cooler than Morrowind. But the realities were harsh, because no one I knew had any idea how to do something like that.\ud83d\udccc Lack of knowledge and first victoryI realized that my knowledge was poor, so I searched through the Internet for information. I found out that websites are based on HTML and decided to collect all the clich\u00e9s of a newbie programmer (started coding websites). But soon I got bored, as I realized that it wasn't going to get me any closer to my own game.\u00a0Luckily, at some point (I was about 9 years old) I got a program called Game Maker. After a month of total confusion, I started making my first game (a simple maze where the hero must get to the finish without hitting the walls). I was carried away by the process, and all the other projects followed (so far without code).\ud83d\udccc Soul searching and the answerWhen I grew old enough to master code, it was time to move on to something more serious. I chose Unity. When I created a few prototypes, I started feeling like I was going to be a programmer. So, I spent the next five years participating in projects for free to improve my skills. But then I realized that I didn't want to spend my time just on code. I enjoy programming, but not 100% of the time (5% at most).Then I thought about something else, so I took up sound design. There I obtained valuable experience in managing teams, translating and dubbing games. I realized that I liked project work. So, as a team leader, I officially got into GameDev, and then into IT (also involved in project management).At the moment, I suppose I am the best when I combine different roles: businessman, manager, and operations manager ( although my interest in GameDev is still with me).Afterword:Of course, my path in IT took more than one day and involved hundreds of books read and dozens of projects that brought no money. But I'm glad I chose it with all its nice (and not so nice) moments.Every path is different, of course, but I wonder if my story is similar to yours in some way at least.","823":"\u041d\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044e \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0438\u0437 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445

Our CEO, Pavel, shares his experience. One pretty common mistake shared by startup founders is that they usually neglect the necessary media coverage of their project. They always pay more attention to the development of new features, searching for investments and daily management routine. What you have to understand is that spreading the word about your product will indirectly help you in all the other areas of your business.For example, a simple social media post about a new feature can quickly help to collect feedback from your target audience and suggest whether it's time to release a new update or there is still something to work on. A well-written article about the project in a respected magazine on its own can urge investors to contact you. A single CEO comment about the working environment and company\u2019s priorities can help hunt the best staff. Such is the power of media. My advice is the following: hire a PR agency, develop a brand positioning strategy, and these investments will pay off in no time.Share your own stories and opinions in the comments. You can also ask our CEO any questions you like and we will answer the most interesting ones in our stories. Stay tuned! #PR #SaaS #Software #experience #strategy","839":"Why use SaaS for engineers?

The life and the career of autistic Temple Grandin is a wonderful example backing my point. She was thought to have little use on a livestock farm and in other careers in general but with some luck, support, and a ton of her own perseverance ended up revolutionizing how livestock farming works around the world!I strongly recommend watching a movie about her. It's a lot of fun too!Let's assume that everyone is talented and stop differentiating people using this word. Some people have just developed their talents while others haven't.The words I suggest instead of the word \"talented\" are \"outstanding\", \"exceptional\", \"extraordinary\", and \"world-class\".

They keep finishing as many tutorials and courses as they can thinking they are learning and improving their skills. But the actual teacher for them is not the instructor who is in that video course, rather it\u2019s the practical hands-on experience. They need to get their hands dirty and apply \u201ctry and fail\u201d approach in learning things to get the real mastery of things. Here are few tips on how to avoid tutorial trap and become expert in any skill you want to learn:1) Try to solve any problem you have on your own first before looking at any tutorial. This way, you will learn how to find the solution by yourself.2) Only look at tutorials when you are stuck and you cannot find the solution by yourself. Do not look at tutorials as your first port of call.3) Try to understand the concepts behind the solution before just copy pasting the code. This way, you will have a better understanding of the problem and you will be able to apply the solution to other similar problems.4) Do not just follow along the tutorial, try to do things on your own and experiment with the code. This way, you will learn the concepts better and you will be able to apply them in other situations.5) Do not just finish the tutorial, try to apply what you have learned in other projects. This way, you will be able to consolidate your knowledge and you will be able to see how far you have come.So these are few tips on how to avoid tutorial trap and become expert in any skill you want to learn. Just remember, the real teacher is the practical hands-on experience and not the tutorials.You can read more in this article: https:\/\/lnkd.in\/dY2G22jj#experience #learning #beginners #tutorialtrap

As it's my first post here, I figured I'd start with a perfect ice-breaker: sharing my recent experience with the Cultural Management certificate course at UniWien. I graduated from the program earlier this year and it was seriously awesome.Honestly, after finishing my bachelor's degree at Higher School of Economics, I wasn't sure I wanted to do another educational program ever again (if you know, you know). But working in the film industry made me realize that I missed the educational environment and the sense of community that comes with it. So when the opportunity to join the course at UniWien came up, I jumped on it.Let me tell you, getting to Vienna at that time and under those circumstances was a literal struggle! But every bit of effort I put into the course was worth it. I'm already applying what I learned to my work and seeing great results. I hope to share some of the exciting things I'm working on in Belgrade soon!One of the best things about the program was the people I met. It's not easy finding like-minded folks, but the Cultural Management certificate course brought together a diverse group of individuals who shared a passion for cultural management. The community we built was pretty special and took a special-special place in my heart.Rumor has it that UniWien is planning to launch a master's program for Cultural Management in the near future\u2026 and I couldn't be more excited! If it's anything like the certificate course, I will be joining the moment it is open for application. And who knows where it could take me?

I wish I'd been a better engineer, (I wasn't great at detail, or maths!) but at least I still have the thought processes which I use in everyday life all the time.  ","981":"I'm in the top 2% of users on StackOverflow. My content there has been viewed by over 1.7M people. And it's unlikely I'll ever write anything there again. Which may be a much bigger problem than it seems. Because it may be the canary in the mine of our collective knowledge. A canary that signals a change in the airflow of knowledge: from human-human via machine, to human-machine only. Don\u2019t pass human, don\u2019t collect 200 virtual internet points along the way.StackOverflow is *the* repository for programming Q&A. It has 100M users & saves man-years of time & wig-factories-worth of grey hair every single day. It is driven by people like me who ask questions that other developers answer. Or vice-versa. Over 10 years I've asked 217 questions & answered 77. Those questions have been read by millions of developers & had tens of millions of views.But since GPT4 it looks less & less likely any of that will happen; at least for me. Which will be bad for StackOverflow. But if I'm representative of other knowledge-workers then it presents a larger & more alarming problem for us as humans. What happens when we stop pooling our knowledge with each other & instead pour it straight into The Machine? Where will our libraries be? How can we avoid total dependency on The Machine? What content do we even feed the next version of The Machine to train on? When it comes time to train GPTx it risks drinking from a dry riverbed. Because programmers won't be asking many questions on StackOverflow. GPT4 will have answered them in private. So while GPT4 was trained on all of the questions asked before 2021 what will GPT6 train on? This raises a more profound question. If this pattern replicates elsewhere & the direction of our collective knowledge alters from outward to humanity to inward into the machine then we are dependent on it in a way that supercedes all of our prior machine-dependencies. Whether or not it \"wants\" to take over, the change in the nature of where information goes will mean that it takes over by default. Like a fast-growing Covid variant, AI will become the dominant source of knowledge simply by virtue of growth. If we take the example of StackOverflow, that pool of human knowledge that used to belong to us - may be reduced down to a mere weighting inside the transformer. Or, perhaps even more alarmingly, if we trust that the current GPT doesn't learn from its inputs, it may be lost altogether. Because if it doesn't remember what we talk about & we don't share it then where does the knowledge even go?We already have an irreversible dependency on machines to store our knowledge. But at least we control it. We can extract it, duplicate it, go & store it in a vault in the Arctic (as Github has done). So what happens next? I don't know, I only have questions. None of which you'll find on StackOverflow.(I write on AI from a technical and product perspective. If you find that interesting then please do follow me for more)","982":"I will not be silent in the face of hypocrites and supporters of terror \u2014 not outside of Israel and even more so at not at

a bunch of great insights from the AustrianStartups workshop on cold email sales by Stephanie Biebel I want to share two things with you that made me see sales in a different light.1. The first rule of Fight Club is: never sell in the first email.Second rule of Fight Club is: never sell... well, you get the idea.If you want to mention your company's name, insert a link to your website, or boast about how amazing you are, you risk ruining the communication with that person forever.First, find out if the person has the pain point you want to solve. And the best call to action in this case would simply be a response of \"YES\" to your email. It is only after the first \"YES\" that you can introduce yourself or your company and then proceed to the long-awaited call.I believe this principle can work in any field, even if you're just looking for a new job.2. I realized that workshops with interaction and, most importantly, some visible results far surpass the typical lecture format. Yesterday's workshop by @Stephanie Biebel was exactly like that. I experienced a lot of emotions, challenged myself, and improved my cold email writing skills. If I have the opportunity to conduct workshops in the future, I will strive to make them lively and engaging, just like this one.A huge thank you to Stephanie and the entire AustrianStartups team!Claudio Rebernig Robin Kulha Ipek Hizar Arne Nostitz-Rieneck Nicole Bilek  #sales #ASmoments #communication","1147":"\u2705 \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043b Frontend JavaScript \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442 \"react pizza\" \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0444\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043e \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0443\u043b \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430 github.\ud83c\udf10\u1d05\u1d07\u1d18\u029f\u1d0f\u028f\u1d07\u1d05: https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gtKfK3MC\ud83d\udcc4s\u1d0f\u1d1c\u0280\u1d04\u1d07: https:\/\/lnkd.in\/gzaz7hpD\u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u0430\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0435 \ud83c\udd75\ud83c\udd81\ud83c\udd7e\ud83c\udd7d\ud83c\udd83\ud83c\udd74\ud83c\udd7d\ud83c\udd73 \ud83c\udd81\ud83c\udd74\ud83c\udd70\ud83c\udd72\ud83c\udd83.\ud83c\udd79\ud83c\udd82 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0430 \ud83d\ude03 \ud83d\udee0 \u0418\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0438: \u00b7 ReactJS 18 \u00b7 TypeScript \u00b7 Redux Toolkit (\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \/ \u043f\u0438\u0446\u0446) \u00b7 React Router v6 (\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f) \u00b7 Axios (\u043e\u0442\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u044d\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0434) \u00b7 React Hooks (\u0445\u0443\u043a\u0438) \u00b7 Prettier (\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0430) \u00b7 CSS-Modules \/ SCSS (\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f) \u00b7 React Content Loader (\u0441\u043a\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043d) \u00b7 React Pagination (\u043f\u0430\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f) \u00b7 Lodash.Debounce \u00b7 Code Splitting, React Loadable, useWhyDidYouUpdate#frontend #javascript #react #flexbox\u00a0#developer #opentowork\u00a0","1148":"\u0413\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043a backend \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a, \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044c \u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439. \u0417\u0430\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043a: TypeScript, Node.JS, nest.js, PostgreSQL. \u0414\u0430\u0436\u0435 puppetter.","1149":"\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0421\u0435\u043c\u043a\u0438\u043d #\u041e\u0442\u0437\u044b\u0432\u044b \u0441 \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044e \u0437\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e #\u041f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0441\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439_\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a ","1150":"\ud835\udde7\ud835\ude06\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfd\ud835\ude01TypeScript is a strongly-typed superset of JavaScript that offers several features to improve code maintainability, scalability, and error catching. It provides a way to catch errors at compile-time, rather than runtime, which can make debugging easier and improve code quality. TypeScript also offers features such as interfaces, classes, and more, which can help developers write more structured, object-oriented code.TypeScript is increasingly popular in the web development community, particularly in front-end development. Its static type checking can help catch errors before they reach the production environment, reducing the risk of bugs and other issues. Additionally, TypeScript can make code easier to read and understand, particularly in larger projects with many contributors.If you are looking to improve your skills as a developer, learning TypeScript is a valuable addition to your toolkit. It can help you write more efficient, maintainable code, and make you a more valuable contributor to your team.If you're interested in exploring TypeScript further, consider checking out some of the many online resources available, including documentation, tutorials, and communities where you can connect with other developers working with the language.to learn more do visit W3Schools.comhttps:\/\/lnkd.in\/de-N53YF#TypeScript #JavaScript #WebDevelopment #FrontEndDevelopment #TypeChecking #TypeSafety #SoftwareDevelopment #CodeQuality #DeveloperTools #TypeScriptTips #Angular #React #VueJS #NodeJS #WebApps #TypeScriptCommunity","1151":"\u041a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0433\u0438, \u043d\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043f\u0435\u043b\u043e!\u042f \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043e \u0442\u043e\u043c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044f \u0438\u0449\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0443. \u0414\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442, \u0440\u0435\u0437\u044e\u043c\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u0430\u043f\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430 HR. \u042f \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043c - \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044e \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u043e \u0434\u0436\u0443\u043d\u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0438\u043f\u0440\u0435. \u0412\u043e\u0442 JS \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0433\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u043a\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u044f\u0442\u044c\u2026\u041d\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f \u044f \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c!\u00a0\u0427\u0430\u0449\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0432 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0442\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e, \u0440\u0435\u0434\u043a\u043e - \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0443\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u043e (\u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0438\u043c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0435, \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0443\u0448\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u0435\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0435).\u00a0\u041d\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f \u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0447\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435: \u201c\u0412\u0441\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e, \u043d\u043e \u0432\u0430\u0448 \u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 8 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446\u0435\u0432, \u0430 \u043c\u044b \u0438\u0449\u0435\u043c \u043e\u0442 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u201d.\u0414\u0430 \u0451@... \u0412\u044b \u0441\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e?

It does not reach the interviews yet, my CV is dismissed at the stages of viewing HR. I was not particularly upset by the refusals - I understand how difficult it is for Junior to find a job in Cyprus. I even started to study JS deeply, so as not to waste time\u2026But today I was really upset!Most often, a standard unsubscription or nothing comes in response from the recruiter, rarely a detailed kind letter (thank them very much, my heart feels warmer).But today I read something like: \u201cEverything is very good, but your experience is 8 months, and we are looking for a year.\u201dOH....@#&@... Are you serious? So formal?And how not to lie after that?!I don't want to embellish anything in my CV! But I'm afraid to forget everything by the time I find a job. I really want to apply my knowledge in work, to know how to apply it in work correctly, and without practice, everything is forgotten very quickly.I'm going to have some wine.","1152":"\u0428\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e React Hooks #react ","1153":"\u0428\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e

The average American child spends about 4 to 7 minutes a day playing outside and over 7 hours a day in front of a screen.It's amazing how my kiddos will come home from school and if not managed will stay attached to their phones. Heck they can't even walk back and forth to the bathroom without it in their face. That's why we must manage their phone time closely. Once thier phone time is up, something incredible happens. For about the first minute or two without their phone they'll complain a little and then the next thing you know they're running all over the yard...swinging on their playset or picking flowers for mom, blowing bubbles, grooming their horses, chasing and running from the geese and goats, getting dragged accross the yard by our big'ole american bulldogs, climbing trees, playing in the creek, searching for crystals or Indian dollars, whatever it may be, they're having fun, laughing, running, jumping, playing...being interactive, just letting go and being kids.It's really quite beautiful to watch!Spending time outdoors isn\u2019t just enjoyable \u2014 it\u2019s also necessary. Many researchers agree that kids who play outside are happier, better at paying attention and less anxious than kids who spend more time indoors.Spending time in nature can build their confidence. There\u2019s a lot less structure than most types of indoor play and they can choose how they interact with the nature around them.

Hmm... That's a good way to get deeply immersed in the topic! Then I thought that my son would be so much fun if I gave him an easy way to play with AI.After reading the documentation, I found that using the API I can access more features than those provided on the UI interface. For example:-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0using different AI models (some faster, some better with translation, and some smarter but slower);-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0changing some parts of my images;-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0creating new variations of my images;-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0generating new images by description;-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0creating a transcription of my audio message.So, two weeks later, we have a first release of my Telegram bot.

Photo 2: This week, getting ready to run training for a client\u2019s employees in Asia timezones from the rather less slick surrounds of my desk at home in Amsterdam, with a webcam, a green screen and my co-presenter hundreds of miles away in Bristol.On that 2018 whirlwind tour I did my prep in Amsterdam, workshops in Hong Kong, a conference talk in Melbourne, more workshops in Sydney, and wrote up my findings while taking an extended route home via the Whitsundays and Bangkok. Eight flights, a whole lot of expense and carbon emissions and nowhere near enough sleep thanks to epic jetlag. Do I miss it? Hell yeah. I had some great opportunities to travel, to explore the world, to meet people. Was it an efficient way to work? If I\u2019m honest, no. There is huge value in meeting face to face to build and sustain relationships. Effective remote working absolutely relies on trust and I know from working in globally dispersed companies that getting to know people makes a HUGE difference in your ability to work with them. But once you have that trust, you can use digital channels to sustain it and to work efficiently and effectively. Coming together now and again helps to establish it and rebuild it as it decays. As an external consultant I often have a core team I work with, and getting to know them and building strong trust relationships is critical to project success. I still travel to meet clients occasionally, as well as to industry conferences to keep in touch with my network. But as organisations - and the people within them - have established effective collaboration practices, the need to travel to do things like focus groups and training is greatly reduced. I\u2019ve certainly got better at planning and delivering these activities remotely, as have the tools to enable this. Running great remote meetings takes careful planning, but the quality of outputs is as good as anything I used to hop on a plane for. Is business travel coming back? No. Not the same extent. Is that a good thing? Probably.#remotework #workshops #businesstravel #futureofwork #newwaysofworking #remoteworking","1321":"We all have to start somewhere.","1322":"U\u0338n\u0338\u0336identified flying objects detected at Kaspersky Drone Security Day.Identified by \ud83d\udc49 https:\/\/lnkd.in\/eD_526Ph","1323":"This will be the most vulnerable thing I'll ever share.I've gone back and forth whether to post this or not.We just had to layoff a few of our employees.I've seen a lot of layoffs over the last few weeks on LinkedIn.Most of those are due to the economy, or whatever other reason.Ours?My fault.I made a decision in February and stuck with that decision for far too long. Now, I know my team will say that \"we made that decision together\", but I lead us into it.And because of those failings, I had to do today, the toughest thing I've ever had to do.We've always been a people first business. And we always will be.Days like today, I wish I was a business owner that was only money driven and didn't care about who he hurt along the way.But I'm not.So, I just want people to see, that not every CEO out there is cold-hearted and doesn't care when he\/she have to lay people off.I'm sure there are hundreds and thousands of others like me.

I work at the Prinses M\u00e1xima Centrum voor kinderoncologie. Although I do not work with patients often, I get to see patients in the foyer on my daily way to the Resesrch department of our building. Many of our patients are missing hair because of chemotherapy. I guess some of them may feel awkward and\/or sad because people around them have hair and they do not. For example, had I suddenly lost all my hair at an age of, say, 10, this would have been a disaster for me. So I thought, if our hairless patients get to see a self-confident hairless adult, maybe this would help them cheer up and feel more self-confident as well. So now I am a self-confident hairless adult! I am going to send the braid to Stichting Haarwensen so that they (hopefully) can make a (part of a) wig out of it and boost someone's self-confidence as well.My hair got cut and my head got shaved by an anonymous kind colleague, an owner of a hair clipper.

Without blood, tissue loses oxygen and dies. This can damage the heart's pumping power and lead to incurable heart failure.After heart failure, the only treatment option for some patients is a heart transplant, but organ donors are far fewer than those on the waiting list. Over 35,000 heart attacks occur in Canada every year, but only 200 heart transplants are performed.\u00a0Although there are 2,000 heart transplants performed annually in the US, there are also 805,000 heart attacks.\u00a0What are beating heart patches?Miniature plaster delivers stem cells designed to heal damaged heart tissue. Stem cells are being used by researchers to make tiny patches that will restore function to damaged cardiac tissue.\u00a0How\u00a0its work1)\u00a0In this process, cells from the skin, blood, or urine of a patient are transformed into stem cells, which are then converted into heart cells. 2)\u00a0Those cells are put into a special gel that encourages them to align and form patches of the heart muscle.

It is sometimes very hard, sometimes very frustrating but extremely rewarding when you suddenly understand something. It's an adrenaline rush. It doesn't matter very much whether somebody else has understood it first or not. It's nice if you're the first person, but just to suddenly understand a puzzle that you have been struggling with for a long time is just fabulous. And it is remarkable that we as humans are capable of understanding the physical world around us in such detail that we can predict things that turn out to be true, that we can understand things that are very far from earth, such as the black holes that we have described colliding with gravitational waves. And that we can use the understanding we develop in the physical laws for technology for human benefit, so that aspect of it also is really quite wonderful.

Fear of working on a global team. Fear of speaking English every day with the NY team without ever having been to the USA.But today everything that scared me is what motivates me! I work at IBM with such wonderful people that the routine of getting up every day, sitting at my desk, turning on the computer and doing what I like has more purpose. Being in a company that knows what it is and values \u200b\u200bdesign is surreal. I recommend!Today is the day to congratulate Vanessa from 2018, who started to migrate her career and entered the UX world. Only she knows everything that went through to get here. Seeing that it was worth it is very good \ud83d\udc99\u2014\u2014\u2014H\u00e1 um ano atr\u00e1s eu tive medo.\u00a0Medo de entrar numa empresa que admirava tanto. Medo de trabalhar num time global. Medo de falar ingl\u00eas todos os dias com o time de NY sem nunca ter ido aos EUA.Mas hoje tudo que me dava medo \u00e9 o que me motiva! Trabalho na IBM com pessoas t\u00e3o maravilhosas, que a rotina de levantar todos os dias, sentar na mesa de trabalho, ligar o computador e fazer o que eu gosto tem mais prop\u00f3sito. Estar numa empresa que sabe o que \u00e9 e valoriza o design \u00e9 surreal. Recomendo!Hoje \u00e9 dia de dar parab\u00e9ns para a Vanessa l\u00e1 de 2018 que come\u00e7ou a migrar de carreira e entrou no mundo do UX.

","1447":"It\u2019s the story of how I was laid off from Google before I even started to do my job there.It began nearly a year ago, in April of 2022, when I applied for multiple #SWE and #SRE positions at #Google. I successfully completed five technical interviews during May and June. In July, I entered the Team Matching Phase where I had the opportunity to meet with hiring managers. After attending two meetings, I realized that I wasn't interested in joining either team at the moment. Regrettably, I had to wait a considerable amount of time for the next opportunity. Google had announced an international hiring freeze, which essentially halted all interview and job offer processes. The freeze did affect me: I was assigned to a different HR manager who informed me that \"Unfortunately we are not in a position to move forward with your application\u201dOnly at the end of September I received news that my candidacy could be submitted to the Hiring Committee before completing the team matching phase. Nearly six months after submitting my application, I was thrilled to learn on October 11 that the Hiring Committee had approved me. The next step was to find a team that was willing to bring me on board. Fortunately, a suitable team was found in November.In December, I received and signed an official offer for a SRE position at Google London. I began preparing for my move by taking an English exam and a mandatory tuberculosis test for Russians working in the UK. After the New Year, I applied to the visa application center, which took nearly two months to issue the visa. In March, I quit my previous company, Yandex, to spend the last month preparing for my move to #London.I had planned to fly out on April 10, giving myself a week to acclimate before starting work on April 17. However, on the evening of April 6, I received an unexpected email from Liz West, the head of Google Cloud HR in Europe, asking to connect with me regarding \u201can update on my Google offer\u201d. During the call, Liz West informed me that my contract with Google had been terminated due to a wave of layoffs that began in the United States and now reached Europe and Britain. \u201cUnfortunately\u201d, my position had come under reduction, so I no longer had the job I had been working towards for the past year. Nothing personal, just business.Thus, the contract with me has been terminated 10 days before it was supposed to take effect.As for what to do next, I am not entirely sure yet. I held a \"garage sale\" and sold most of my belongings. The remaining items were either discarded, recycled, or packed into two suitcases that I had planned to take with me. Moving to a new country is a difficult task that typically requires months of preparation. Changing these plans on the fly is challenging and somewhat painful. So I literally don\u2019t know. However, I feel that I should say something optimistic at the end. Everything will be good \ud83d\ude42 #layoff","1448":"Liza and I had a great time participating in Data Dojo as speakers!","1449":"One month ago our team took a prize for solving VTB's MORE.Tech data track challenge.

My dad ended up challenging me to see which of us could finish an online Python class fastest, and after a week he had given up on it and I ended up being super interested in the material. I taught myself how to code using online resources throughout middle school, and when I got to high school I was able to take CS classes. Since then, I\u2019ve always known that I want to go into software engineering.\u201dIn the latest #MyPathToGoogle, software engineering intern Livia Seibert shares how a fun coding competition with her dad led her to becoming an intern at Google \u2192 https:\/\/goo.gle\/2UOWgHE#GoogleInterns","1496":"The most important thing I look forward to in my professional life is -I want to work with nice people.Thats it.Everything else comes second.#mentalhealth#careerchoices","1497":"\u201cWhat I like the most about my role is when I\u2019m facing a problem I\u2019ve never solved before, so off I go to learn new skills and work with people across the company to come up with a solution.\u201d We chatted with Leonardo Moleiro, an Analytical Lead for SPLA (Spanish Speaking Latin America) who was born in Caracas, Venezuela and works at our Bogot\u00e1, Colombia office.
